OpenGL extensions survey results
================================

Here are the results from the recent OpenGL survey.

We collected 89 `glxinfo` output files in all. There were 40 extensions in the
so-called [lowest common denominator list](lcd.txt), the set of extensions
supported by all contributors. And here's the list of [all extensions with
percentages](all.txt).

Thanks to everyone who contributed!
